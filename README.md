1. Simulate NRZ, RZ, half-sinusoid and raised cosine pulses and generate eye diagram for binary polar signaling.  2. Simulate the Pulse code modulation and demodulation system and display the waveforms.  3. Simulate the QPSK transmitter and receiver. Plot the signals and its constellation diagram.  4. Test the performance of a binary differential phase shift keying system by simulating the non-coherent detection of binary DPSK.
